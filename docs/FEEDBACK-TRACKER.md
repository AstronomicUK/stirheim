# Feedback Tracker

Every bug and improvement Tom sends, logged as its own entry in his own words. Nothing here is
paraphrased or trimmed when it's added — the point of this file is that no detail from a report
gets lost between "Tom said it" and "it's fixed," however small the item looks at a glance.

## How this works

1. When Tom sends a new list (or a message that bundles several issues together), each distinct
   item is broken out and logged below as its own numbered entry under a new dated batch. The
   "Reported" block is a **verbatim quote** of what he wrote for that specific item — not a
   summary — even when it was one sentence inside a longer combined message.
2. Every entry gets a **priority** when it's logged (see below). Tom's own wording sometimes makes
   this obvious; where it doesn't, a reasonable priority is assigned and can be corrected.
3. New entries start **Open**. Within a batch, items are worked highest priority first, then top to
   bottom; an item that can't be finished (needs a decision, a screenshot, more information) is
   marked **Blocked** with why, and work moves on to the next one rather than stalling the batch.
4. An entry moves to **Fixed** once it's implemented and verified (tested, or checked live in the
   browser where that applies), then **Deployed** once that fix has actually shipped to Netlify —
   with a one-line note on what changed and the commit it landed in.
5. Nothing is deleted. A fixed batch stays in the file as the record of what was reported and how
   it was resolved; new batches are added below the older ones.

## Batch — 2026-09-07 (outstanding work logged retroactively)

Nothing below was reported as a fresh bug on this date — these are loose ends already known from
earlier work, logged here so they don't get forgotten now that the tracker exists.

### 1. Dice rolls in the persisted combat log don't say app-rolled vs entered by hand

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** 2026-09-06 (part of a larger list)

> "All dice rolls should show app-rolled vs manually-entered; scenario selection should say '(randomly chosen)' when applicable."

**Notes:** Done for the live Fight tab UI (`RollResult` tags "Rolled by the app" / "Entered by hand") and for `DieField`s in the post-battle wizard, and the scenario half is fully done. Not done: the *persisted* attack narrative written to the combat log (`rollThrough.ts`'s `log()` calls, ~30 call sites) still always says "rolled X", regardless of which way that particular die actually came in. Threading it through would mean passing a `manual` flag into `applyRoll`/`declineRoll` and rewording every log line — judged out of scope for that pass since the live UI already shows it at the moment it matters.

### 2. Cast a Spell rolls have no app-rolled / entered-by-hand tag

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** 2026-09-06 (part of the same list as #1)

**Notes:** Same request as #1, but for `CastTab.tsx`. Its `RollResult` reads `CastState.dice` directly rather than going through the `shown`-bucket pattern `FightTab.tsx` uses, so the same fix doesn't drop in without touching `casting.ts`'s state shape too.

### 3. Confirm the Cast tab's new friendly-target picker against a real spellcaster

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟠 Medium
**Reported:** n/a — self-identified gap, not something Tom flagged

**Notes:** Added an optional "Target (if this spell needs one)" field to `CastTab.tsx` so a spell that needs a friendly target (a heal, a blessing) has somewhere to record one, per Tom's "spell casting sometimes needs friendly-only targeting." Implemented, typechecked and covered by the full test suite, but never exercised live — none of the seeded test warbands (`gm@stirheim.test` / `player@stirheim.test`) have a spellcaster. Worth a real check next time a warband with a wizard or priest is in play.

### 4. Simulator's out-of-action grid only shows the attacking direction

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** n/a — scope note from building item below

**Notes:** The old `mordheim-simulator` project's sensitivity grid had an Attacking/Defending toggle (attacker hits the opponent, or the opponent hits back). The new "Against a range of opponents" section on Stirheim's Simulator → Odds tab only ported the attacking direction, matching how the rest of that tab already works one-directionally. Adding the reverse toggle is a reasonably contained follow-up if it turns out to matter.

### 5. The injury-enforcement audit only covered two injuries

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟠 Medium
**Reported:** 2026-09-06 (part of the same list as #1)

> "Injury audit: are things like Old Battle Wound actually enforced?"

**Notes:** Old Battle Wound (pre-battle D6, benches on a 1) and Severe Arm Wound (no second weapon/shield/buckler) are now enforced — those were the two gaps identified at the time. The question was broader than those two by its own wording ("things *like*"); nobody has since gone through every other injury outcome in `rules/data/injuries` checking each one actually changes app behaviour rather than just sitting on the sheet as text. Worth a proper full pass rather than assuming the two found so far were the only ones.

### 6. Two large rules-completeness audits already exist and are still open

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** n/a — pointer to pre-existing docs, not a new report

**Notes:** [`docs/WARBAND-RULES-GAPS.md`](WARBAND-RULES-GAPS.md) and [`docs/WEAPONS-ARMOUR-RULES-GAPS.md`](WEAPONS-ARMOUR-RULES-GAPS.md) are dated 2026-09-05 audits of warband special rules and weapon/armour rules that are documented but not mechanically enforced (dozens of specific items each, e.g. per-warband exploration bonuses, income modifiers, units that never gain experience). Left as their own documents rather than duplicated in here item-by-item — this entry exists only so the tracker doesn't quietly forget they're there. Say the word if these should be folded into this tracker as individual entries instead.

### 7. The map is buggy in a Map Campaign: phantom nodes, selection mostly doesn't work

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🔴 High
**Reported:** 2026-09-07

> "the Map is buggy if you open it in the Map Campaign; it has nodes to tap on that don't exist, almost all selections don't work (they don't show you what the node is when you click or mouse over)"

**Notes:** Investigated, not yet fixed. Three separate things going on, all in `src/features/map/MapCanvas.tsx` and `src/rules/data/map/districts.ts`:

1. **"Nodes that don't exist" — likely explained by four districts sitting below the bottom edge of the map image.** The SVG viewBox is `0 0 100 70.725` (`MAP_VIEW_HEIGHT`), matching the image's exact aspect ratio, but four of the thirty districts have a `y` coordinate greater than 70.725: `temple-of-morr` (72.55), `the-cemetery` (71.15), `poor-quarter` (71.3), and worst, `south-gate` (74.2, a gate district with several connections). Their circles sit past the visible image, so they render clipped or invisible at the very bottom edge, while the connecting lines to them (`MAP_LINKS`) still draw normally, ending at a spot with no visible circle — which would read exactly as "a node to tap on that isn't there." Every id, connection reference and coordinate range was checked by script; these four `y` values are the only anomaly (ids are all unique, no connection points at a missing id, no districts sit on top of each other).
2. **Selection mostly not registering — most likely a pointer-capture bug.** `onPointerDown` unconditionally calls `frame.current?.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)` on the outer map frame, for every pointer-down including one that starts right on a district circle. Once an element has pointer capture, the browser retargets subsequent pointer events (and, in most browsers, the derived `click`) to the *capturing* element rather than whatever is visually underneath. `onPointerUp`'s own fallback-deselect check — `if (!moved && (e.target as Element).tagName !== 'circle') onSelect(null)` — is written assuming `e.target` can still be a `circle`, but under capture it's almost always the captured frame `<div>` instead, so that condition is true for nearly every simple tap and immediately deselects, racing against (or outright suppressing) the circle's own `onClick`. This would explain "almost all selections don't work" precisely — panning/zooming (which only need the frame, not per-circle clicks) still works fine, which fits what was reported.
3. **No hover tooltip exists at all, so "mouse over doesn't show what the node is" is accurate as a description of current behaviour, not a regression.** Each district circle only carries an `aria-label` (screen-reader only, nothing visible) — there's no `title`, tooltip or on-hover label anywhere in `MapCanvas.tsx`. The only place a district's name and details show at all is the `DistrictPanel` in the sidebar once a *click* successfully selects it (which is broken per #2), so right now there's no way to identify a district without that click path working. A hover affordance would need to be built new, not repaired.

Given all three sit in the same small file, a fix would likely address them together rather than one at a time. Left as Open per instruction — investigation only for now.

### 8. Parrying may not be working properly in roll-it-out; wants the same hand-off armour saves get

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🔴 High
**Reported:** 2026-09-07

> "I'm not sure parrying is working properly in roll it out. it should probably work similar to armour saves (where you can roll the parry yourself or ask the defender to roll and it sends it to their app), but obviously only when the defender has a weapon that they can parry with."

**Notes:**

### 9. Better visual representation of multiple attacks — pick attack count up front, label "First attack" / "Second attack"; likely to merge with upcoming items about stunned/knocked-down targets

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟠 Medium
**Reported:** 2026-09-07

> "then another one is better visual representation of multiple attacks. when you open the popup, it should give the option to select how many attacks, detailing the maximum for that character. then you should have "first attack", "second attack" etc. there are more bugs to come that link to this, so you might need to merge some. particularly related to attacking stunned or knocked down foes"

**Notes:** Tom has flagged this as likely to need merging with further related reports about attacking a target that's already stunned or knocked down — holding off on investigation/fix until those arrive so the whole picture is in one place rather than half-solved here and revised later.
