# Feedback Tracker

Every bug and improvement Tom sends, logged as its own entry in his own words. Nothing here is
paraphrased or trimmed when it's added — the point of this file is that no detail from a report
gets lost between "Tom said it" and "it's fixed," however small the item looks at a glance.

## How this works

1. When Tom sends a new list (or a message that bundles several issues together), each distinct
   item is broken out and logged below as its own numbered entry under a new dated batch. The
   "Reported" block is a **verbatim quote** of what he wrote for that specific item — not a
   summary — even when it was one sentence inside a longer combined message.
2. Every entry gets a **priority** when it's logged (see below). Tom's own wording sometimes makes
   this obvious; where it doesn't, a reasonable priority is assigned and can be corrected.
3. New entries start **Open**. Within a batch, items are worked highest priority first, then top to
   bottom; an item that can't be finished (needs a decision, a screenshot, more information) is
   marked **Blocked** with why, and work moves on to the next one rather than stalling the batch.
4. An entry moves to **Fixed** once it's implemented and verified (tested, or checked live in the
   browser where that applies), then **Deployed** once that fix has actually shipped to Netlify —
   with a one-line note on what changed and the commit it landed in.
5. Nothing is deleted. A fixed batch stays in the file as the record of what was reported and how
   it was resolved; new batches are added below the older ones.

## Batch — 2026-09-07 (outstanding work logged retroactively)

Nothing below was reported as a fresh bug on this date — these are loose ends already known from
earlier work, logged here so they don't get forgotten now that the tracker exists.

### 1. Dice rolls in the persisted combat log don't say app-rolled vs entered by hand

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** 2026-09-06 (part of a larger list)

> "All dice rolls should show app-rolled vs manually-entered; scenario selection should say '(randomly chosen)' when applicable."

**Notes:** Done for the live Fight tab UI (`RollResult` tags "Rolled by the app" / "Entered by hand") and for `DieField`s in the post-battle wizard, and the scenario half is fully done. Not done: the *persisted* attack narrative written to the combat log (`rollThrough.ts`'s `log()` calls, ~30 call sites) still always says "rolled X", regardless of which way that particular die actually came in. Threading it through would mean passing a `manual` flag into `applyRoll`/`declineRoll` and rewording every log line — judged out of scope for that pass since the live UI already shows it at the moment it matters.

### 2. Cast a Spell rolls have no app-rolled / entered-by-hand tag

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** 2026-09-06 (part of the same list as #1)

**Notes:** Same request as #1, but for `CastTab.tsx`. Its `RollResult` reads `CastState.dice` directly rather than going through the `shown`-bucket pattern `FightTab.tsx` uses, so the same fix doesn't drop in without touching `casting.ts`'s state shape too.

### 3. Confirm the Cast tab's new friendly-target picker against a real spellcaster

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟠 Medium
**Reported:** n/a — self-identified gap, not something Tom flagged

**Notes:** Added an optional "Target (if this spell needs one)" field to `CastTab.tsx` so a spell that needs a friendly target (a heal, a blessing) has somewhere to record one, per Tom's "spell casting sometimes needs friendly-only targeting." Implemented, typechecked and covered by the full test suite, but never exercised live — none of the seeded test warbands (`gm@stirheim.test` / `player@stirheim.test`) have a spellcaster. Worth a real check next time a warband with a wizard or priest is in play.

### 4. Simulator's out-of-action grid only shows the attacking direction

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** n/a — scope note from building item below

**Notes:** The old `mordheim-simulator` project's sensitivity grid had an Attacking/Defending toggle (attacker hits the opponent, or the opponent hits back). The new "Against a range of opponents" section on Stirheim's Simulator → Odds tab only ported the attacking direction, matching how the rest of that tab already works one-directionally. Adding the reverse toggle is a reasonably contained follow-up if it turns out to matter.

### 5. The injury-enforcement audit only covered two injuries

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟠 Medium
**Reported:** 2026-09-06 (part of the same list as #1)

> "Injury audit: are things like Old Battle Wound actually enforced?"

**Notes:** Old Battle Wound (pre-battle D6, benches on a 1) and Severe Arm Wound (no second weapon/shield/buckler) are now enforced — those were the two gaps identified at the time. The question was broader than those two by its own wording ("things *like*"); nobody has since gone through every other injury outcome in `rules/data/injuries` checking each one actually changes app behaviour rather than just sitting on the sheet as text. Worth a proper full pass rather than assuming the two found so far were the only ones.

### 6. Two large rules-completeness audits already exist and are still open

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🟡 Low
**Reported:** n/a — pointer to pre-existing docs, not a new report

**Notes:** [`docs/WARBAND-RULES-GAPS.md`](WARBAND-RULES-GAPS.md) and [`docs/WEAPONS-ARMOUR-RULES-GAPS.md`](WEAPONS-ARMOUR-RULES-GAPS.md) are dated 2026-09-05 audits of warband special rules and weapon/armour rules that are documented but not mechanically enforced (dozens of specific items each, e.g. per-warband exploration bonuses, income modifiers, units that never gain experience). Left as their own documents rather than duplicated in here item-by-item — this entry exists only so the tracker doesn't quietly forget they're there. Say the word if these should be folded into this tracker as individual entries instead.

### 7. The map is buggy in a Map Campaign: phantom nodes, selection mostly doesn't work

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🔴 High
**Reported:** 2026-09-07

> "the Map is buggy if you open it in the Map Campaign; it has nodes to tap on that don't exist, almost all selections don't work (they don't show you what the node is when you click or mouse over)"

**Notes:**

<!-- New batches go below this line, most recent last. Copy the entry template for each item. -->

### N. Short title

**Status:** 🔲 Open
**Priority:** 🔴 High / 🟠 Medium / 🟡 Low
**Reported:** YYYY-MM-DD

> Verbatim text of what Tom said about this item.
